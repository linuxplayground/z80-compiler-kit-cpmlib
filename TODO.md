# The ToDo List

The order of this list is completely meaningless.

- [ ] General
    - [ ] Finalize IO ports for Retro and Nouveau to support ROM WBW
    - [x] Rework build system to build all the targets at once or just specific
        targets
    - [x] Rework build system to have target specific source files.  This is needed
    - [x] Install scripts
    - [x] Work on improving documentation - it's currently a MESS!
    for NABU support.
- [ ] TARGET: NABU
    - [ ] Write NABU support functions - ISR for keyboard and joystick.
    - [ ] NABU - cpm_rawio needs to be updated to support how NABU / CloudCPM works
        together for Joystick Input.
